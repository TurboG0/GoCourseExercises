Todd McLeod - Learn To Code Go - Page 97
○ purpose of functions
■ modular code
■ abstracting code
■ code reusability
● DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself
○ parameters vs arguments
○ syntax
■ func, receiver, identifier, params, returns, execute
■ returns
● multiple returns
● named returns // Todd doesn't like
○ variadic parameters
○ unfurling a slice
○ defer
○ methods
○ interfaces & polymorphism
■ stringer interface
■ wrapper func
● logging example
■ writer interface
● writing to file or byte buffer
○ anonymous func
○ func expressions
■ assigning a func to a variable
○ returning a func
■ functions are first class citizens
○ callbacks
■ passing a func into another func as an argument
○ closure
■ one scope enclosing another
■ variables declared in the outer scope are accessible in inner scopes
■ closure helps us limit the scope of variables
○ recursion
■ a func that calls itself
■ factorial
● life philosophy
○ focus on what’s important; not upon what’s urgent
